- A sudden feeling of nostalgia made me think about the old games that I played on the pc.
- Especially that one game - Metal Knight: Mission Terminate Resistance

-I tried several years back to run the game (which I still have on CD) directly in my Windows 10 machine, but it couldn't run even with compatibility options enabled.

-So, I finally came up with a solution: using a virtual environment to install windows xp (I'm sure it will work, because I originally played on windows XP).
-So first, I chose which version of windows XP to install, which is obviously the SP3 as it's the most advanced and secure.
-Then I bought the licence and installed the operating system in my Virtual Box.
-Installing Windows XP is taking way longer than expected

Update: having trouble installing Windows XP - too slow or gets stuck during installation
Fixes: RAM set to 4GB and CPU set to 1 processor (more processors actually slow down windows XP due to increased CPU oversight). XP x64 is not recognized by VirtualBox - Using the x86 version
Looks like the version of XP I used was compromised. Now dowloading a different version from Archive.org
